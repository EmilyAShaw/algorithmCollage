### Final

Bags from the iconic. I decided for my final I would select all bags, male and female from the site theiconic.co.nz. I chose this based on my idea for shoes - I really liked shoes but I did want something a bit more colourful, and shoe was limited to mostly black, grey, brown, nude, and white. Where as bags often come in a huge range of styles and colours. I took the concept of industrial and uniformity from the shoes, as I still wanted to use the iconic website for itâ€™s similar background/angle photography techniques. 

images I manually filtered out. I filtered out the images in the downloads folder, that included hands and fingers in them. i did this to encourage the uniformity of the piece, and having skin tones and hands thought this would not have done so efficiently. I also made the decision to filter out a lot of black, as black is a very common colour when it comes to handbags.

I really really like the colour grid - I have chosen this one to focus on, as even though smartgrid did a good job at ordering them by size, colour grid did a more distinct job by ordering by colour. I believe this is because the bags are are distinct in their colour than they are by size and shape. Custom grid did not do as much for me, as it seemed to order it by handle vs no handle.

The zones that were particularly effective were top right and the mid left, the mid left is almost entirely backpacks. I believe this is because most of the images are filled up with backpack, and therefore according to the algorithm appear darker and bigger. The top right is dedicated solely to purses which is cool, I think this has been done for the same yet opposite reason...
